# IBMi-Ping
Wrapper around ping command to avoid giving a limit to number of attempts. This was written because I was bored/wanted to prove a connection issue wasn't the IBMi at fault as it was the other end which was dropping offline.

Full source from an article I wrote in 2019: https://powerwire.eu/ping-unto-eternity/

Suggested improvements if you're bored and want to play:
1. Convert pingtest to free-format RPG (or handle the record write another way.)
